If information is presented in accordance with the learning style, then they'll learn better. Now there are dozens of different learning style theories, but the most common one identifies four main learning styles. Visual, auditory, reading, writing, and kinesthetic, or VARC for short. Visual learners learn best from images, demonstrations, and pictures. People may say things, but I can't really like take it in. I just got to see them act it out or write it or something. Auditory learners learn best from listening.to an explanation. Reading writing learners learn best from reading and writing. And kinesthetic learners learn best by doing, physically interacting with the world. Hands on, you have to touch things, you have to play with things. It's a contact sport. You have to do it yourself. Now, learning styles make intuitive sense because we know everyone is different. Some people have better spatial reasoning. Others have better listening comprehension. We know some people are better readers while others are good with their hands. It sort of very much fits with a broad strain of thought in the recent Western tradition is. like we're all unique, we're all different. And so you don't want to say like everybody learns the same way. That sort of conflicts with our feelings about what it means to be human. So doesn't it make sense that people should learn better in their own preferred learning style? Well, teachers certainly seem to think so. A survey of nearly 400 teachers from the UK and the Netherlands found that over 90 percent believed that individuals learn better when they receive information in their preferred learning style."
